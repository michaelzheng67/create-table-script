# Literally just a python script to create a plaintext table

Why? Because sometimes you might need to include a table in your txt file but you have no easy way to generate one

works on my computer running python3.7

Example Usage:

` 
python3 create_table.py "Age,Education,Marital Status, Gender, Political Party"
`
